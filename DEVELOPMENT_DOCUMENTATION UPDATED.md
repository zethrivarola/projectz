## Files Modified/Created in This Session

### 1. Fixed Cover Photo Bug (COMPLETED)
**File:** `src/app/api/collections/[slug]/cover/route.ts`
**Issue:** Line 102 called `storage.saveCollections()` which doesn't exist
**Fix:** Changed to use `storage.updateCollection()` method

### 2. Fixed Share Link Creation Bug (COMPLETED)
**File:** `src/app/api/collections/[slug]/share/route.ts`
**Issue:** Response format mismatch - API returned `shareToken` but dialog expected `accessToken`
**Fix:** Updated API response format and added flexible slug/ID handling

### 3. Enhanced Design System (COMPLETED)
**File:** `src/app/api/collections/[slug]/design/route.ts`
**Issue:** Using `setCollection()` instead of `updateCollection()` preventing design changes
**Fix:** Updated to use proper storage method with enhanced logging
**New Features:**
- Fixed design persistence bug
- Added GET endpoint for loading design settings
- Enhanced error handling and logging

### 4. Enhanced Design Interface (COMPLETED)
**File:** `src/app/collections/[slug]/design/page.tsx`
**Issues:** Basic controls, no auto-save, limited preview
**Enhancements:**
- Auto-save functionality with toggle
- Enhanced color picker controls
- Professional typography controls with font previews
- Improved grid spacing controls (4-32px range)
- Live preview with better visual feedback
- Reset to defaults functionality
- Better state management and error handling

### 5. Scrollable Client Gallery (COMPLETED)
**File:** `src/app/gallery/[token]/page.tsx`
**Change:** Converted from button-based navigation to seamless scrolling
**Features:**
- Single-page scroll experience (cover → gallery)
- Smooth scroll animations with "View Photos" button
- Scroll indicators and back-to-top functionality
- Preserved all existing favorites functionality response now returns `accessToken` instead of `shareToken`
- GET endpoint returns proper share format for existing links
- Added DELETE endpoint for share regeneration

## Favorites System Architecture (Planned)

### Current Understanding
Based on Pixieset screenshots provided, the system needs:

1. **Client View (Shared Gallery)**
   - Heart icons appear on photo hover (alongside download)
   - Clients can favorite/unfavorite photos
   - Visual feedback when photos are favorited
   - Anonymous tracking (no login required)

2. **Photographer View (Activities Dashboard)**
   - "Favorite Activity" tab showing client selections
   - Track which photos are most favorited
   - Client engagement analytics
   - Email registration tracking

### Technical Implementation Plan

#### Database Schema (Prisma-based)
Current system uses Prisma ORM with existing tables:
- `PhotoFavorite` - tracks client photo selections
- `ViewActivity` - logs client interactions
- `CollectionShare` - manages shared gallery access

#### API Endpoints Created/Modified
1. **`/api/gallery/[token]/favorites`** - Enhanced Prisma-based favorites API
   - POST: Add/remove favorites with anonymous tracking
   - GET: Retrieve favorites data and analytics
   - Supports both anonymous and email-identified clients

#### Storage System
Two approaches considered:
- **File-based storage** (current system) - JSON files for metadata
- **Prisma database** (discovered existing system) - PostgreSQL backend

Current system uses Prisma, so we're adapting to that architecture.

## Implementation Status

### Completed
- [x] Cover photo update bug fix
- [x] Share link creation bug fix
- [x] Enhanced Prisma favorites API endpoint
- [x] Anonymous client tracking system

### In Progress

- [ ] Photographer activities dashboard
- [ ] Email registration integration

### Pending
- [ ] Bulk download favorites functionality
- [ ] Real-time activity notifications
- [ ] Analytics dashboard for photographers
- [ ] Email notification system

---

## Current Issues & Blockers

### Share Link Testing
- Share links now create successfully after API fix
- Need to test client gallery view with favorites functionality
- Client gallery should be at `/gallery/[token]` route

### File Structure Clarification
- Photographer view: `/collections/[slug]` (collection management)
- Client view: `/gallery/[token]` (shared gallery access)
- Favorites should appear in CLIENT view, not photographer view

---

## Next Steps (Priority Order)

### Immediate (Next Session)
1. **Test share link creation** - Verify fixed API works
2. **Update client gallery page** - Add favorites UI to `/gallery/[token]/page.tsx`
3. **Test favorites functionality** - Heart icons, visual feedback, persistence
4. **Create activities dashboard** - Show client selections to photographers

### Short Term
1. **Email registration integration** - Track client emails with favorites
2. **Bulk operations** - Download selected favorites
3. **Analytics enhancement** - Photo popularity metrics

### Medium Term  
1. **Real-time notifications** - Alert photographers of new favorites
2. **Advanced analytics** - Client engagement patterns
3. **Mobile optimization** - Touch-friendly favorites interface

## Key Technical Details

### Authentication Flow
- Photographers: JWT-based authentication for collection management
- Clients: Anonymous access via share tokens (no login required)
- Client identification: Hashed browser fingerprint for privacy

### Data Privacy
- Anonymous client tracking using hashed identifiers
- Optional email collection for enhanced tracking
- GDPR-compliant data handling

### Performance Considerations
- Optimistic UI updates (client-side immediate feedback)
- Graceful degradation if backend sync fails
- Efficient database queries for analytics

## Testing Checklist

### Share Link Creation
- [ ] Create new share link from collection
- [ ] Copy share link to clipboard
- [ ] Access shared gallery as anonymous client
- [ ] Verify password protection works

### Favorites Functionality
- [ ] Heart icons appear on photo hover
- [ ] Click heart adds/removes favorites
- [ ] Visual feedback (red heart, border)
- [ ] Favorites counter in header
- [ ] Favorites persist across sessions
- [ ] Bulk download works

### Activities Dashboard
- [ ] Photographer can see client favorites
- [ ] Photo popularity analytics

- [ ] Email registration logging

---

## Session Outcome

**Status:** Share link creation fixed, favorites system architecture designed, ready for client gallery implementation.

**Next Priority:** Update client gallery page with favorites functionality and test the complete user flow.

**Key Learning:** System uses Prisma database backend, not file-based storage as initially assumed. All favorites tracking should integrate with existing database schema.
